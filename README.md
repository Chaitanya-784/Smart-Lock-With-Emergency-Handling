# Smart-Lock-With-Emergency-Handling
This project implements a smart lock system that unlocks via a biometric authentication feature from a mobile application and connects via Bluetooth to nearby devices. It includes an emergency auto-unlock mechanism, where the lock disengages automatically when a fire is detected.

Features:
Biometric Authentication: Unlocks the door using the phone's fingerprint scanner.
Bluetooth Connectivity: Communicates with the lock system via an HC-05 module.
Emergency Handling: Auto-unlocks the door if the fire sensor detects high smoke levels.
Real-time Alerts: Sends emergency notifications to the connected mobile app.
Hardware Components: Includes a solenoid lock, relay module, Arduino Uno, and fire sensor.
Technologies Used:
Android App (Kotlin/Java)
Arduino Programming (C++)
Bluetooth Communication
